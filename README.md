## A) Introduction
The purpose of this project is investigate earthquakes occured around the Juan de Fuca plate. Using date collected from USGS, all number and magnitude of earthquakes need to be plotted in a geometry map base on thier coordinate. From the plots, location and patterns of earthquakes can be analized and comparing with real tectonic boundary map to check the accurate. Moreover, there are events that happened in the past related to the data.

## D) Results:
### Part I: Wind and Rain Noise
|           | Oregon Shelf (80m Depth) | Oregon Offshore (580m Depth) |

## E) Conclusion:
• What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.

• Which one has the highestimpact? Rain or wind?

• What arethe main reasonsforobservingdifferentspectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore? 

• Compare the bandwidth of these three signals. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve(refer to the Ocean Noise slides)?
